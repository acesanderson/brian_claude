Each design case is framed as a narrative that includes email exchanges, supporting diagrams, and CLI outputs, focusing on topics such as Layer 2 protocols, enterprise IP routing with EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, and MPLS, software-defined networking with SD-WAN, network security, and more. As you progress, you’ll be asked to make key design decisions—analyzing requirements, weighing trade-offs, and selecting the best solutions under exam-like constraints. &nbsp; This course is tailored for engineers preparing for the Design Module of the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Lab Exam , and for the CCDE Practical Exam , where success depends on high-level reasoning and solution design, not command-line skills. By practicing with these immersive, exam-style scenarios, you’ll sharpen your critical thinking, analysis, and decision-making skills, giving you the confidence to perform under the pressure that Cisco’s expert-level exams demand. &nbsp; &nbsp; Important Information In the actual exams, backwards navigation is disabled in the testing engine. We recommend attempting each design scenario for the first time without using the back button , as information revealed in later emails, diagrams, etc. will often point to the previous correct answers. Once you have completed a scenario, you may re-attempt it and browse forwards and backwards through the questions to better understand why the solution answers are correct. At the end of each scenario attempt, you can review the questions that were marked wrong. To review the full correct solution path for a scenario, click through the quiz without answering any questions (this will result in a score of 0/10 ) and then reveal the solutions for all questions. &nbsp;",

    "description": "Social engineering in the context of penetration testing (pentesting) refers to the practice of manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. It plays a crucial role in pentesting by identifying vulnerabilities in an organization's human element, often considered the weakest link in security. People or employees are the hardest part of an enterprise network to secure. Even with the best technology and defenses, an attacker can still compromise a system through poor practices or accidental mistakes. Malicious actors exploit this weakness, making it one of the most effective ways to infiltrate an organization. Social engineering exploits psychological aspects such as trust, fear, curiosity, and the inherent willingness of employees to help. Techniques include phishing, pretexting, baiting, and tailgating, aiming to trick employees into revealing passwords, clicking on malicious links, or granting unauthorized access. This testing helps organizations understand their susceptibility to human-based attacks and develop more effective training and security measures.\n\n\nThis course will introduce you to Social Engineering as a concept and practice, it will also provide you with a historical understanding of Social Engineering and will introduce you to the various Social Engineering Techniques leveraged by attackers.  You will also learn when and how to leverage Pretexting to exploit human psychology and emotions when communicating with individuals and organizations.

As Linux offers multi-user tenancy, the common perception is that it is impossible to escalate privileges to root.\n\nThe focus of this bootcamp is to familiarize you with beginner-to-advanced privilege escalation techniques on Linux. You will learn to identify and leverage misconfigurations to perform horizontal/vertical escalation. The bootcamp will cover techniques starting from traditional privilege escalation methodologies to advanced concepts such as Linux capabilities. Completing the bootcamp and passing the certification exam will prepare you for performing privilege escalation effectively on Linux-based machines.",

Telemetry provides the same (if not more detailed) data using a \"Push\" model in which telemetry subscriptions cause your networking devices to push relevant data to you. This course reviews some of the foundational elements required for telemetry to work (such as APIs, NETCONF and YANG) and then introduces you to the concepts and terminology behind model-driven telemetry. You will also see a lab demonstration of creating a dynamic, dial-in telemetry subscription and even have lab opportunities to experience for yourself what it is like to create dial-in and dial-out telemetry subscriptions!",

You'll start with Lambda, including best practices and how to implement functions with infrastructure as code (IaC). Then you dive into learning about Event Bridge, including how to use it to schedule calls to Lambda. From there, you study the Simple Notification Service and Simple Queue service. After that, you finish the tour of the major serverless services with the API Gateway. But this is more than just a theory and lecture series; you'll also build using serverless services. By the end of the course, you will have a complete system for monitoring the availability of websites that require monitoring.

The ENARSI exam primarily tests your ability to troubleshoot advanced routing and services-related networking features, but how does one prepare for this? How do you gain practical, hands-on experience with troubleshooting?  With THIS course!  INE’s ENARSI Practice Labs course has almost 50 labs designed to cover all of the topics described as either “configure” or “troubleshoot” in the ENARSI exam blueprint. In our course, you’ll be given dozens of opportunities to identify what is wrong with a network, fix it, and then view a solution to see if you resolve the problem correctly. There are also several “configuration” labs to ensure you can configure topics required to pass the ENARSI exam, such as advanced IGP redistribution, DMVMP, and IPsec. So dive right in and let the troubleshooting begin!",

In this course, we will look at those solutions together. As builders, we will go beyond surface details and examine how we can create solutions that improve performance or the supported applications. And in some cases, we will change how we look at a particular service to better understand its potential.\n\nTogether we will look at the following:\n\n-Relational databases using the Amazon Relational Database Service\n\n-Building resilient solutions in Amazon RDS\n\n-Understanding the performance and architectural implementation of Amazon Aurora\n\n-A quick talk on the evolution of NoSQL\n\n-Building in Amazon DynamoDB, including performant table design, data modeling, streaming, concurrency, etc.\n-Working with Amazon CloudFront to build global caching systems\n-How caching for Amazon DynamoDB can be cached using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)\n-Support for database caching using ElasticCache\n-Big data support using RedShift, EMR, QuickSight, and Kinesis\n\nIt’s a course with many drill-downs to improve your knowledge and understanding of databases, big data, and caching in AWS. So whether you are building a primary MySQL database to support a small application, explaining the difference between SQL and NoSQL, starting a big data project, or improving the performance of your database applications, this is the course for you.",

Utilizing platform services tends to reduce operational costs and complexity, however, relying on the cloud for platform hosting does introduce its own administrative requirements. This course covers what application management looks like in the cloud. We will cover the reasons organizations move their application workloads to the cloud, define common application services provided by the cloud vendors, and get hands-on experience configuring and administering cloud application services. The majority of the course will be focused on common cloud-provided services such as web application hosting, serverless applications, container services, and messaging systems. The course will also cover application diagnostics as well as introduce infrastructure as code as a means to deploy and maintain application infrastructure.\n\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\n* Enumerate common application services available in the cloud\n* Deploy and manage common cloud application hosting resources \n* Deploy and manage common cloud application support services\n* Execute a simple templated cloud resource deployment \n\nRecommended Knowledge or Skills Prior to Taking this Course:\n\n* Cloud foundations \n* Web application hosting \n* Container fundamentals",

In this course you'll be explosed to a high-level overview of the architecture of the Junos Operating System and its major components. We'll start by explaining how the Junos OS is actually an application that relies on an underlying OS of either FreeBSD or Linux, and why this is to your benefit. You'll hear about some of the differences between legacy Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved. You'll be introduced to the Forwarding Plane, Data Plane and Management planes...their relevance to Juniper devices, and where they are implemented. We'll introduce you to the importance of Juniper's Routing Engine (RE) and Packet Forwarding Engines (PFE) and their interactions with each other. And finally you'll learn how Junos OS implements protocol daemons, how to identify problematic daemons, and how to restart them.",

This course will cover the three primary forms of static routing including Static Routes, Floating Static Routes, and Static Default Routes. You will learn the theory and implementation of these from both an IPv4 and IPv6 perspective. You will also see actual demonstrations of these done on Cisco and Juniper routers so you can compare and contrast the implementation similarities and differences.",

As a result, more and more worldwide companies are finding themselves implementing IPv6 into their networks which requires implementing an IPv6 Routing Protocol that can quickly and accurately propagate information about those prefixes. Frequently Network Engineers turn to OSPFv3 to meet this need. This course assumes you have basic knowledge about IPv4 OSPF (OSPFv2) and takes you to the next level by covering OSPFv3 for IPv6 networks. In this course, you will learn about the implementation and operational differences between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. You'll be able to identify the new-and-changed OSPFv3 LSA Types within your OSPFv3 database. And you'll master the techniques to configure and monitor OSPFv3 on your network. In order to compare and contrast implementation differences you'll be shown Lab Demonstrations and configuration commands on Juniper and Cisco equipment with Lab Demonstrations designed on freely available online Sandbox environments that you can access yourself, if you wish to follow along with the instructor.",

Mitigations against common authentication and authorization attacks are up next. Specifically, you will learn how to protect your applications against user enumeration, brute force attacks, default credentials being active, authentication schema bypasses, path traversal attacks, local file inclusion attacks, IDOR attacks etc. Session management is another important module you will come across during the PWD course, in which you will learn how to mitigate session fixation, exposed session variables, CSRF etc. Business logic flaws and their impact on the overall security posture of an application is also covered with clear examples. As you would have guessed, proper data validation is covered in detail, in order to mitigate attacks such as XSS, HTTP parameter pollution, ORM, SQLi, XXE, SSI, XPATH injection, Command injection, RFI and many more. A holistic defense approach should not neglect attacks against crypto implementations and web services (XML & JSON-RPC, SOAP & REST, spoofing/action attacks, etc.). Applied secure coding is also included highlighting matters such as attack surface reduction, strict input validation, least privilege principle, secure access to data & functions etc. When no access to code is provided, virtual patching is the way to go. PWD teaches how to perform virtual patching and how to leverage it for intrusion detection/prevention purposes.

You’ll learn details of Wi-Fi modulation and encoding and what a “chipping sequence” is. We will discuss RF power and how it can be measured using Decibels, dBi, dBm and the “rule of 10s and 3s”. You’ll then be exposed to some of the ways that 802.11n, ac, and ax have increased Wi-Fi throughput exponentially in the past several years.  We’ll move on to lightweight access points, how they discover their WLAN controllers and how controller failover is achieved. You’ll also learn about the components that make up antennas, different types of antennas and how to measure their gain (or loss) using Polar Plots. We’ll teach you about WLAN Roaming, Web authentication, 802.1x with EAP…and a whole lot more!",

This is where YANG, NETCONF, and RESTCONF come into play.  This course is designed to help you understand what role NETCONF, RESTCONF, and YANG play in this emerging realm of Network Automation and Programmability.  From an introductory session on Data Modeling, you’ll learn what YANG Modules are, where they can be found and how to view them.  We’ll then move into how NETCONF and RESTCONF are used as transport mechanisms to securely deliver data that meets YANG standards. So if you’ve wanted to learn what YANG, NETCONF, and RESTCONF are…this is the course for you!",

For example, it will not cover SDN to the depth needed for the Data Center CCIE, however, it will be sufficient for Route Switch or Security. If your particular CCIE track covers these topics in greater depth, you will need additional training in addition to this course.",

However, its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness i.e. it is extremely difficult to do macroscopic analysis, create custom reports, extract only certain fields from packets for offline analysis, etc. This is where Tshark comes in! Tshark is a command-line tool created by the Wireshark team and shares the same powerful parsing engine as Wireshark. It is capable of doing most things we've come to love Wireshark for, but with the \"from the command line\" advantage. This makes it ideal for batch analysis, offline processing, and routine automation of traffic analysis tasks. In this course, we will explore many of these capabilities. It is assumed you have a basic working knowledge of Wireshark and traffic analysis.",

In this course, we will look at how to analyze, mangle, transform and visualize data to derive interesting insights and intelligence from it. Pandas is a Python library that is part of the SciPy scientific computing ecosystem. In simple terms, Pandas provides powerful data structures to perform data analysis. As dry as this might initially sound, due to the high level of abstraction provided by its powerful API, Pandas allows us to do really complicated analysis with just a few lines of Python code. In this course, we will go through the basics of Numpy, a deep dive into Pandas Series and Dataframes, and how to analyze data with it. The case study used is the analysis of Wi-Fi networks using Airodump-NG’s output file for a relatively large network with hundreds of devices.",

    "description": "Before one dives into the details of various routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP, you need to learn the basics of routing.  What is meant by the term “Routing”?  Why is this technology needed in modern networks? What exactly happens to an IP Packet and an Ethernet Frame when it is routed? Where, in the architecture of a router, are “routes” stored?  How does a router select which route to use when it knows of multiple routes to the same destination? This and much more are covered in this course.  This course is intended for those studying for their ICND1 CCNA Exam.",
