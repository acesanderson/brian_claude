# Licensing Criteria Reference

Evaluation criteria for LinkedIn Learning content licensing opportunities.

## Context

LinkedIn Learning is pivoting from organic production to an 80% licensed / 20% organic content model. The goal is to scale the library by ingesting third-party content that meets quality and format requirements.

## Volume Scoring

| Score | Threshold | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| `high` | 50+ courses | Strong catalog depth, significant partnership |
| `medium` | 20-49 courses | Meets threshold, room for growth |
| `low` | 5-19 courses | Minimum viable, may need supplementation |
| `insufficient` | <5 courses | Does not meet licensing threshold |

**Note**: 5+ courses is the minimum for a licensing deal. Below this, recommend bundling with other content or waiting for catalog growth.

## Format Fit Scoring

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| `likely` | Majority standalone video or sequential multimedia; 30min-2hr per course; chunkable to 5-15min segments |
| `possible` | Mixed formats, some compatible; may require production work |
| `unlikely` | Primarily interactive/SCORM/lab-based; requires instructor interaction |
| `unknown` | Cannot determine from catalog metadata |

**Disqualifiers** (auto-flag if detected):
- Webinar recordings (low production quality)
- AI-generated voice or avatar
- Interactive labs or SCORM packages
- Content requiring real-time instructor interaction

## Brand-Topic Fit Scoring

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| `strong` | Partner is recognized authority in course topics |
| `moderate` | Partner has credibility but not primary expertise |
| `weak` | Topic mismatch or brand dilution risk |
| `unclear` | Cannot assess from available information |

**Red flags** (glaringly bad fit):
- Palantir teaching data ethics
- Meta teaching responsible AI
- Oracle teaching DEI
- Any vendor teaching "objective" comparison of their product vs competitors

## Potential Blockers

Auto-detect and flag these concerns:

| Blocker | Detection | Impact |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Content freely on YouTube | YouTube links in course pages | Reduces exclusivity value |
| Certification program | Cert/credential mentioned | Cannibalization concerns; partner may resist |
| Interactive elements | Labs, simulations, SCORM | Won't transfer to LiL platform |
| Webinar recordings | "Webinar" in title, live Q&A sections | Production quality concern |
| AI voice/avatar | AI-generated indicators | Quality concern |
| Product marketing tone | Heavy CTAs, "buy now", feature pitches | Violates learner-focused requirement |
| Email gate | Email required to view catalog | Partner prioritizes lead-gen; may resist distribution |

## Alignment Levers

When assessing "why would they say yes," consider which lever applies:

| Lever | Description | Typical Partner |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Exposure** | Distribution to 30M+ enterprise learners, 1B+ members | Tier 1 brands (Google, Adobe, NVIDIA) |
| **Revenue** | 15% non-exclusive / 20% exclusive royalty | Publishers, smaller orgs, influencers |
| **Awareness** | LiL as top-of-funnel for their platform | Learning platforms (Cybrary model) |
| **Commitment** | Public upskilling pledges to fulfill | Companies with stated training goals |

## Recommended Next Steps by Assessment

| Assessment | Next Step |
|------------|-----------|
| Volume: high, Format: likely, Brand: strong | Review 2-3 courses for quality, then initiate outreach |
| Volume: medium, Format: likely, Brand: strong | Review courses, identify decision-maker |
| Volume: low, Format: likely, Brand: strong | Consider for niche gap-fill or bundle |
| Any blocker flagged | Document blocker, assess if resolvable |
| Format: unlikely | Likely not a fit unless platform evolution planned |
| Brand: weak | Likely not a fit; topic authority matters |
