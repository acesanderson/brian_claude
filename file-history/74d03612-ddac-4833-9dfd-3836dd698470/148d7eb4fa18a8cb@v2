description: Discover training portal URLs for companies. Use when the user needs to find course catalog or training platform URLs for one or more companies before scraping them. Takes company names as input and outputs structured data with discovered training platform URLs. Trigger phrases include "find training URLs for [companies]", "discover course catalogs for [companies]", "locate learning platforms for [companies]", or when preparing to scrape multiple companies without known URLs.

# Find Catalogues

Discover training portal URLs for companies using web search and reconnaissance.

## Input

**Company names** - One or more company names (e.g., "Zapier", "KodeKloud", "DeepLearning.AI")

## Output

Structured JSON mapping each company to its discovered training platform URL(s):

```json
{
  "Zapier": {
    "primary_url": "https://learn.zapier.com/courses",
    "alternative_urls": ["https://zapier.com/university"],
    "confidence": "high",
    "notes": "Dedicated learning platform with structured course catalog"
  },
  "KodeKloud": {
    "primary_url": "https://kodekloud.com/courses/",
    "alternative_urls": [],
    "confidence": "high",
    "notes": "Main site with /courses path"
  }
}
```

## Workflow

For each company:

### 1. Web Search for Training Platforms

Search for variations:
- `"{company name}" training courses`
- `"{company name}" learning platform`
- `"{company name}" academy`
- `"{company name}" certification courses`
- `"{company name}" education portal`

### 2. Identify Candidate URLs

Look for:
- Dedicated learning domains (e.g., `learn.company.com`, `academy.company.com`, `university.company.com`)
- Main site training sections (e.g., `company.com/training`, `company.com/courses`, `company.com/learn`)
- Third-party platforms (e.g., Skilljar, Thinkific, Teachable hosting)

Common patterns:
- `learn.{domain}` or `academy.{domain}` or `training.{domain}`
- `{domain}/courses` or `{domain}/learning` or `{domain}/training`
- `{domain}/education` or `{domain}/certifications`

### 3. Validate URL Quality

Use WebFetch to verify each candidate URL:
- Does it contain a course catalog or listing?
- Is it publicly accessible (not behind authentication)?
- Does it have structured course data?

**Confidence levels:**
- `high` - Dedicated learning platform with clear course catalog
- `medium` - Training section exists but structure unclear
- `low` - Limited information, may require authentication
- `none` - No training platform found

### 4. Return Results

Output JSON with:
- `primary_url` - Best candidate for scraping
- `alternative_urls` - Other potential training URLs found
- `confidence` - Assessment of URL quality
- `notes` - Brief description of platform type and any obstacles

## Output Format

Save results to `training_urls.json`:

```json
{
  "discovery_date": "2026-02-09",
  "companies_searched": 14,
  "companies_found": 12,
  "results": {
    "Company Name": {
      "primary_url": "https://...",
      "alternative_urls": ["https://..."],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low|none",
      "notes": "Description of platform"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Search broadly** - Try multiple search query variations
2. **Verify with WebFetch** - Don't assume URLs are valid without checking
3. **Note obstacles** - Document authentication walls, CAPTCHA, or other barriers
4. **Prioritize official platforms** - Prefer company-owned domains over third-party hosted content
5. **Be concise** - Keep notes brief but informative

## Example Usage

**Input:** `["Zapier", "KodeKloud", "DeepLearning.AI"]`

**Process:**
1. Search "Zapier training courses" → Find `learn.zapier.com`
2. WebFetch `https://learn.zapier.com` → Verify course catalog exists
3. Repeat for remaining companies
4. Output structured JSON with all findings

**Output:** `training_urls.json` with discovered URLs and confidence ratings
