# Obsidian Save

Save content to the user's Obsidian vault at `/Users/bianders/morphy` as markdown notes.

## Quick Start

When the user asks to save content, use the Write tool to create a markdown file at `/Users/bianders/morphy/filename.md`.

**Examples:**

User: "Save this as a note about Python logging"
→ Write to `/Users/bianders/morphy/Python logging.md`

User: "Create a note called 'API ideas'"
→ Write to `/Users/bianders/morphy/API ideas.md`

User: "Capture this meeting summary"
→ Ask for filename, then write to `/Users/bianders/morphy/[filename].md`

## Filename Guidelines

- Use the user's specified filename if provided
- Otherwise, derive a clear, descriptive filename from the content
- Use natural naming: spaces are fine, keep it readable
- Add `.md` extension
- Examples: `Meeting notes 2026-01-28.md`, `Python best practices.md`, `Bug fix ideas.md`

## Creating Notes

Use the Write tool with these practices:

**For new notes:**
- Always use full absolute path: `/Users/bianders/morphy/filename.md`
- Use clean markdown formatting
- Include headings, code blocks, lists as appropriate

**For appending to existing notes:**
- First Read the existing note
- Then Write with the original content + new content appended

## Wikilink Support

When creating notes that reference other content:
- Use Obsidian wikilink format: `[[Page Name]]`
- Link to related notes: `See also [[Related Topic]]`
- No need to check if linked notes exist - Obsidian handles broken links gracefully

**Example:**
``
# API Design Notes

Key concepts from [[REST API Patterns]] and [[Authentication Methods]].

## Related
- [[Database Schema]]
- [[Frontend Integration]]
``

## Content Types

Handle all content types appropriately:

**Meeting notes/summaries**: Use headings, bullet points, clear structure
**Code snippets**: Use code blocks with language tags
**Research/web content**: Preserve formatting, add source links
**Quick captures**: Simple, direct - just save the content

## Workflow

1. Determine filename (use provided name or derive from content)
2. Check if appending to existing note or creating new
3. Format content appropriately in markdown
4. Write to `/Users/bianders/morphy/filename.md`
5. Confirm to user what was saved and where
```
