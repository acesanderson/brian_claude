name: batch-dispatch
description: Orchestrates parallel, isolated execution of a skill across a list of inputs.
---

## Usage
/batch-dispatch <skill_name> <list_of_inputs> <instruction_template>

## Examples
/batch-dispatch "scrape-catalog" '["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com"]' "Scrape the catalog from {{ item }} and save the pricing table."

## Implementation
This skill delegates to a Python script that spawns parallel `claude` subprocesses. 
It uses `uv` to manage the execution environment ephemerally.

Steps:
1. Locate the `batch_runner.py` script in the `references/` sibling directory.
2. Run it using `uv run`.

#!/bin/bash
# Find the directory where this skill is stored to locate the reference script
SKILL_DIR=$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")
SCRIPT_PATH="$SKILL_DIR/references/batch_runner.py"

# Execute via uv. We pass the arguments exactly as provided.
# $1 = skill_name, $2 = json_inputs, $3 = prompt_template
uv run "$SCRIPT_PATH" "$1" "$2" "$3"
