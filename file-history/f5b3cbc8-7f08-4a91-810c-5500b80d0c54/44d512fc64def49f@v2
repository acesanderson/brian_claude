# Weights & Biases Academy Catalog Scraping Report

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**URL**: https://wandb.ai/site/courses/
**Total Courses**: 12

## Architecture

- **Type**: Single-page catalog with navigation-based filtering
- **Data Source**: Server-rendered HTML with course cards; individual course pages scraped for detailed metadata
- **Obstacles**: None - publicly accessible content
- **Technology**: WordPress/Elementor with custom post types

## Extraction Method

### Strategy: Two-phase HTML scraping

1. **Phase 1 - Catalog Page**:
   - Fetched main courses page
   - Identified 12 course elements using CSS selector `[class*="type-academy"]`
   - Extracted: Title, URL, Category (from CSS classes)

2. **Phase 2 - Individual Course Pages**:
   - Visited each course URL to fetch detailed metadata
   - Extracted course-specific descriptions from meta tags
   - Parsed page content for duration and level indicators
   - Applied 1-second delay between requests to be respectful

### Technical Details

- Used BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Meta description tags provided high-quality course summaries
- Duration extracted via regex pattern matching
- Level keywords detected from page content
- All courses confirmed as free and on-demand format

## Data Quality

| Field | Completeness | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Provider | 100% | All courses from W&B Academy |
| Title | 100% | Clean, concise titles (avg 28 chars) |
| URL | 100% | Direct links to course pages |
| Description | 100% | Course-specific descriptions (91.7% unique) |
| Duration | 92% | Extracted from course pages; some generic "4 Min" values likely from preview/trailer |
| Level | 58% | 7 courses have explicit levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Basic) |
| Format | 100% | All on-demand/self-paced |
| Price | 100% | All free courses |
| Category | 100% | Llms (7), Mlops (4), International (1) |

### Quality Assessment

**Title Quality**: Excellent
- Average title length: 28 characters
- All titles are concise and descriptive
- No issues with description text bleeding into titles

**Description Quality**: Excellent
- 91.7% unique descriptions (11 of 12 courses)
- One duplicate description for Japanese RAG course (uses same description as English version)
- All descriptions are course-specific, not generic catalog text
- Descriptions clearly explain what each course teaches

**Duration Accuracy**: Needs improvement
- Most durations show "4 Min" which likely refers to preview/intro video length
- One course correctly shows "2-hour" duration
- Recommend manual verification of actual course durations

**Level Data**: Moderate
- 7 of 12 courses have level information
- Levels present: Beginner (2), Intermediate (1), Advanced (4), Basic (1)
- 5 courses missing level data

## Course Distribution

### By Category
- **LLMs** (7 courses):
  - AI Engineering: Agents
  - LLM apps: Evaluation
  - RAG++ : From POC to production
  - Developer's guide to LLM prompting
  - LLM engineering: Structured outputs
  - Building LLM-powered apps
  - Training and fine-tuning LLMs

- **MLOps** (4 courses):
  - Model CI/CD
  - Effective MLOps: Model development
  - CI/CD for machine learning (GitOps)
  - Data validation in production ML pipelines

- **International** (1 course):
  - RAG++ :  PoCから本番運用へ (Japanese version of RAG course)

### By Level
- **Advanced**: 4 courses
- **Beginner**: 2 courses
- **Intermediate**: 1 course
- **Basic**: 1 course
- **Unspecified**: 4 courses

## Limitations

1. **Duration Data**: Most courses show generic "4 Min" duration, which appears to be preview video length rather than full course duration. Only 1 course showed accurate full duration.

2. **Level Information**: 42% of courses lack explicit level designation in course metadata.

3. **Additional Metadata**: The following fields were not available on course pages:
   - Instructor names
   - Prerequisites
   - Certification information
   - Enrollment counts
   - Ratings/reviews
   - Last updated dates

4. **Language Courses**: Japanese version of RAG course has identical English description (not translated).

## Recommendations

### For LinkedIn Learning Licensing Perspective

**Strong Alignment**:
- All courses are free, making licensing discussions straightforward
- Focus on cutting-edge LLM/GenAI topics (agents, RAG, structured outputs, evaluation)
- Strong MLOps coverage aligns with enterprise needs
- Clear learning objectives in course descriptions

**Content Gaps vs. LinkedIn Learning**:
- W&B Academy is highly specialized (LLMs/MLOps only)
- No business skills, creative skills, or general technology courses
- Very technical audience (ML engineers, data scientists)
- Focused on W&B tooling integration

**Licensing Considerations**:
1. **Niche Expertise**: Excellent for filling LLM/GenAI content gaps in LinkedIn Learning catalog
2. **Tool-Specific**: Courses teach W&B platform integration - consider if this aligns with LinkedIn Learning's tool-agnostic approach
3. **Free Content**: May have different value proposition than paid LinkedIn Learning courses
4. **Target Audience**: Very specialized - appeals to ML practitioners, not general professional audience

**Recommendation**: Strong candidate for specialized partnership. W&B Academy fills critical gaps in LLM engineering and MLOps content. Consider:
- Co-branding arrangement
- Integration as "Partner Content" track
- Focus on courses with broader applicability (prompting, evaluation) vs. tool-specific ones (CI/CD with W&B)

### For Future Scraping

1. **Duration Enhancement**: Manually verify course durations or extract from course syllabus/curriculum sections
2. **Level Standardization**: Map varied level terminology to consistent taxonomy
3. **Instructor Extraction**: Check course detail pages for instructor bios (if available)
4. **Curriculum Details**: Scrape lesson/module structure for more detailed course outlines
