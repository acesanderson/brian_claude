The user needs to check their settings.json file\n\nThe agent asked what the user's MCP server startup scripts look like, which is a good follow-up question. I should present this information to the user clearly and see if they want to share their configuration for further debugging.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1296,"cache_read_input_tokens":22308,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1296,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXxmgJefmR3XMqABdYNkX","type":"assistant","uuid":"c3f67ff9-9211-4f85-8e47-31ed9a713157","timestamp":"2026-02-09T15:58:22.883Z"}

Here are the key points:\n\n## Configuration Location\n\nMCP servers must be registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` (not in your project directory). Each server needs:\n- A `command` field (the executable to run)\n- An `args` array (arguments to pass)\n- Optionally, `env` variables\n\n## Example Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"my-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/server.js\"]\n    },\n    \"another-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"python\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/server.py\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Common Issues\n\n1. **JSON syntax errors** - Missing commas, trailing commas, or invalid JSON\n2. **Wrong command path** - The command must be in your PATH or use absolute paths\n3. **Missing required fields** - Both `command` and `args` are required\n4. **Need to restart** - Changes require restarting Claude Code\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Read your `~/.claude/settings.json` to see what's configured?\n2. Help you add your new MCP servers to the configuration?\n\nWhat MCP servers did you create, and how are you trying to run them (what command/path)?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1296,"cache_read_input_tokens":22308,"output_tokens":484,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1296}}},"requestId":"req_011CXxmgJefmR3XMqABdYNkX","type":"assistant","uuid":"c6f891c4-0a73-47f5-bc4b-7032a10e5741","timestamp":"2026-02-09T15:58:28.276Z"}

If `/mcp` shows \"No MCP servers configured,\" this could mean:\n\n1. **Claude Code needs to be restarted** - Changes to `settings.json` require a restart\n2. **The servers were created elsewhere** - Did you create them in a different location?\n3. **There's a configuration validation issue** - The env variable syntax or server path might be causing it to fail validation\n\n## Where did you create your MCP servers?\n\nYou mentioned creating \"a couple\" of servers - where are they located? Are they:\n- In the working directory (`/Users/bianders/Brian_Code/sandbox/scraping`)?\n- In a different location?\n- Do you need to add them to `settings.json`?\n\nThe key point: **MCP servers don't auto-register**. You must manually add each server to the `mcpServers` object in `~/.claude/settings.json`, even if they're in the `~/.claude/mcp-servers/` directory.\n\nIf you created servers elsewhere, tell me where they are and I'll help you add them to the configuration."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":456,"cache_read_input_tokens":51576,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":456,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXxmqUdCE2prwyptwZKBY","type":"assistant","uuid":"ce176a0a-7205-4c93-8afb-f5dda02ec141","timestamp":"2026-02-09T16:00:33.966Z"}
